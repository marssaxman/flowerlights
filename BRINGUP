How to set up the Raspberry Pi Zero W to run as a flower head device.

Start with basic Raspbian:
  <https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest>

Get a copy of the fadecandy server:
  cd /home/pi
  git clone https://www.github.com/scanlime/fadecandy/

Set the server to run at startup:
  sudo nano /etc/rc.local

As the second-to-last line, before 'exit 0', insert this line:

    sudo /home/pi/fadecandy/bin/fcserver-rpi


Install the 'uncomplicated firewall' tool:
  sudo apt install ufw

Verify that it is installed but not yet running:
  sudo ufw status

You should see "Status: inactive".

Set up the basic configuration:
  sudo ufw default deny incoming
  sudo ufw default allow outgoing
  sudo ufw allow ssh

Additionally allow the fadecandy server connection port:
  sudo ufw allow 7890

Enable the firewall:
  sudo ufw enable
